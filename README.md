# Voice Recognition Project

This project focuses on **voice recognition** using machine learning techniques.  
We extracted audio features and applied models like **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **RNN** for classification.  
The system is designed to recognize different speakers and voice patterns accurately.  
Data preprocessing included noise reduction and feature normalization for better performance.  
Evaluation metrics such as **F1-score** and **accuracy** were used to validate the models.  
This project demonstrates how AI can be applied to speech processing and voice-based authentication.

## Features
- Voice classification using multiple machine learning models
- Audio feature extraction and preprocessing
- Accurate speaker recognition
